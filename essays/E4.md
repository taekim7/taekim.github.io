Assignment 1 presented a formidable challenge during this course, yet it became a pivotal learning experience for me. The journey of tackling the assignment solo, coupled with seeking guidance from both my professor and classmates, enriched my understanding. In instances where obstacles arose, the collaborative spirit within our class fostered an environment of shared knowledge, allowing us to troubleshoot and discover effective solutions together. This dynamic exchange of ideas not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also reinforced the sense of camaraderie within our academic community.
Utilizing the skills we learned from out past labs and WODs, to create our own ecommerce website was a great way for myself to learn how to put stuff together
to make a website work. 
What helped me the most were the lecture videos Professor Sal posted. He explained a lot of his codes in details while showing us how he did his, which gave me a clear understanding of what must be done.
