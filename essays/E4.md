My programming skills have greatly improved, especially while we were on our first assignment. Now, I know the basic concepts of HTML, JS, and CSS to create a website, with some help.
Some things I need to work on to improve my programming skills are tryring to code from memory, without any help. 
Another way the class helped me were the WODs and Labs we had to do throughout the semester. It helped me because they gave me the knowledge of the basic concepts to create a website. 
Assignment 1 was extremely challenging, but it was a pivitol learning experience. Trying to put an ecommerce website together alone at first made me search more about the codes I was trying to apply. I believe I am ready for Assignment 2, but will be another mountain of challenge to overcome and learn from the experience. 
I think the class can be improved by incorporating maybe a group activity for students to get together and work together. This way, maybe someone who is knowledgable can help fellow students because they're in a group now. 
What helped me the most were the videos that Sal posted for us explaining details of the codes and how they should work. The group session we had for Assignment 1 was very helpful too.
